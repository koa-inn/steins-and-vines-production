  "story-text-2": "First crossing paths as colleagues at Backcountry Brewing, co-owners Koa and Paul bonded instantly over shared passions for disc golf, mushroom foraging, their dogs, and of course, craft beer. Supported by the strategic business acumen of their wives, the duo took ownership of Squamish’s local u-vin in 2026. Formerly known as Wine and Brew, the shop has been rebranded as Steins and Vines to reflect their dual expertise. By blending a legacy of fine winemaking with a new focus on high-quality, all-grain beer, they are proud to provide premium batches and homebrewing supplies to the entire Sea-to-Sky Corridor.",

  "owner-1-name": "Paul McLachlan",
  "owner-1-bio": "Paul moved to the Sea to Sky corridor in 2009 and has proudly called it home ever since. Over the past 16 years, he has built a diverse professional background, but it was discovering home brewing that truly sparked his passion. After crafting his very first batch, Paul was hooked. What began as a hobby quickly grew into a dedicated pursuit of the craft. In the spring of 2020, he joined the team at Backcountry Brewing, where he refined his skills and deepened his knowledge while working alongside an exceptional group of brewers. Today, Paul is excited to expand his expertise into the world of winemaking. He looks forward to sharing his experience, creativity, and passion with fellow enthusiasts, helping others bring their own brewing and winemaking visions to life.",
  "owner-2-name": "Koa Inn",
  "owner-2-bio": "Koa loves bold reds, crispy lagers, and a fresh loaf of sourdough bread. He started homebrewing with his university roommates, which expanded into a full scale obsessive hobby. After several experimental brews at the homebrew level, Koa worked professionally as a brewer and cellerman at Backcountry Brewing where he learned commercial scale production techniques and sanitization standards. Hoping to continue his craft for fermentation, Koa became owner of Steins and Vines in 2026, aiming to help others make the best beer and wine possible.",

  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "What is ferment-on-premises?",
      "answer": "Ferment-on-premises (also called U-Brew or U-Vin) lets you make your own beer, wine, or cider at our licensed facility using professional equipment. You visit us twice: once to start your batch (~10 minutes) and again to bottle when it's ready (~20\u201330 minutes). We handle the fermentation in between."
    },
    {
      "question": "How much does a batch make?",
      "answer": "Each batch produces approximately 23 litres, that's around 29\u201330 bottles (750 mL) or around 64 cans (355 mL)."
    },
    {
      "question": "How long does fermentation take?",
      "answer": "It depends on the product. Most wine kits take 4\u20138 weeks before being ready to bottle. The product card for each kit shows the estimated production time."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do I need any experience?",
      "answer": "Not at all. We guide you through every step. You don't need to bring anything. We provide all the equipment, ingredients, and bottles."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I bring my own bottles?",
      "answer": "Yes! You're welcome to bring clean, standard 750 mL wine bottles or 341/500 mL beer bottles and we can sanitize them in-store. We also have bottles and cans available if you need them."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do I need to make an appointment?",
      "answer": "We recommend reserving online so we can have everything prepared for you, but walk-ins are welcome when we have availability."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's the difference between kit-only and ferment-in-store pricing?",
      "answer": "Kit-only means you purchase the ingredient kit to take home and brew yourself. Ferment-in-store includes the kit plus use of our facility, equipment, and guidance. We store and monitor your batch until it's ready to bottle."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is the wine or beer subject to liquor taxes?",
      "answer": "No. Because you make it yourself on our premises, your batch is not subject to liquor taxes, which is one of the reasons ferment-on-premises is so affordable compared to buying from a store."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is there a minimum age requirement?",
      "answer": "Yes, you must be 19 or older (BC's legal drinking age) to make wine or beer at our facility."
    },
    {
      "question": "What if I don't like how my batch turned out?",
      "answer": "We offer a 100% satisfaction guarantee. If your batch isn't what you wanted, we'll replace it with another kit or recipe, no questions asked."
