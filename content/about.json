  "owner-1-bio": "Paul moved to the Sea to Sky corridor in 2009 and has proudly called it home ever since. Over the past 16 years, he has built a diverse professional background, but it was discovering home brewing that truly sparked his passion. After crafting his very first batch, Paul was hooked. What began as a hobby quickly grew into a dedicated pursuit of the craft. In the spring of 2020, he joined the team at Backcountry Brewing, where he refined his skills and deepened his knowledge while working alongside an exceptional group of brewers. Today, Paul is excited to expand his expertise into the world of winemaking. He looks forward to sharing his experience, creativity, and passion with fellow enthusiasts, helping others bring their own brewing and winemaking visions to life.",
